    "\n",
    "Here I describe my implementation of the box-counting algorithm, which is used to estimate the fractal dimension of the Urban Form.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write my code, I used elements from three sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://francescoturci.net/2016/03/31/box-counting-in-numpy/\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44793221/python-fractal-box-count-fractal-dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "The above are python implementations of the box counting algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also used elements and checked the description of this MATLAB code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/13063-boxcount?focused=5083247&tab=example\n",
    "\n",
    "(I have seen a paper ( https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1470160X16303168/1-s2.0-S1470160X16303168-main.pdf?_tid=8dab1834-b542-4ba7-b67b-3b705d6a310e&acdnat=1549146490_1fc7cf97fa0f3f57d4d1fe73fe78b24b ) using that code, so I suppose I can trust it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's give a short description of the code/algorithm; more comments on the code itsel:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first step is to get an rgb image (such as a .png generated from the plot functions of OSMnx) and transform it to a grayscale, that is a 2-dimensional matrix with a numerical value between 0 and 1 in each point (pixel). Note the counter-intuitive fact of this transformation: regions that are darker in the original picture, get a value close to 0 and pixels that are white get a value close to 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Denote the matrix resulting from this process as X. The main function $\\texttt{fractal_dimension(X, threshold)}$ gets as an input this matrix and a threshold (between 0 and 1). [That will be used to binarize the matrix; as a default I use threshold = 0.5. That means that all pixels with value less than 0.5 (remember, values close to zero mean that there was a building/road etc in the original photo - in practice most pixels that represent a part of a building will have a value of 0, except some pixels in the boundaries that are a bit shaded... )].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This function performs the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1) Counts the number of 2-dimensional boxes (squares) needed to cover the pixels with a value below our threshold. The box sizes, $s$ are powers of 2. $s = 1, 2, 4, \\dots, 2^P$ (the size refers to the number of pixels in each side of the 2 dimensional box).  $P$ is the smallest integer such that max(size(X)) <= $2^P$. \n",
    "   \n",
    "  2) If the sizes of X over each dimension are smaller than $2^P$, X is padded with ones to size $2^P$ over each dimension ( for example a $320 \\times 200$ image is padded to $512 \\times 512$).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3) To count the number of boxes of size $s$, I use the 2-d histogram function of scipy: First I find the positions in the (padded) matrix X that have a value less than the threshold. Then I get the 2 dimensional histogram of them with bins equal to size $s$. Last, I count the non-zero bins; this is the number of boxed we are looking for.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4) Thus we get arrays of sizes $s$ and number of counts $N$, both of size $P + 1$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  5) The box-counting fractal dimension is defined as:\n",
    "  \\begin{equation}\n",
    "  D_{box} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{N(s)}{1/s}\n",
    "  \\end{equation}\n",
    "  In practice, we plot $N(s)$ vs $s$, we perform a linear fit and get as our estimate of the fractal dimension the inverse of the slope.\n",

    "More details in the code...\n",

    "### Modification of the original code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here i modify the code, such us I calculate the FD of cities where now I set in all cases a minimum scale (resolution) typical of the building size of each city/part of city.\n",
